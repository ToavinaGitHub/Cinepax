  <strong>Cinepax<strong> would like to create an intranet information system that will manage the sale of cinema tickets.
This system will make it possible to:
<ul>
  <li>Manage ticket sales with a seat selection system</li>
  <li>Manage the sale of ancillary products (popcorn, drinks, 3D glasses, etc.)</li>
  <li> To have the statistics</li>
</ul>
    Cinepax has several theaters, with films that are shown at every hour slot (e.g. 10:30 a.m.,
12 noon, 2:30 pm, etc...). Each room has numbered seats per row (e.g. A1 to A10, B1 to B1,...J1 to J10)
